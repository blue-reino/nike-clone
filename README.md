# Basic Nike Website Clone (WIP)

A very simple Nike Wesbite Clone. It's not exactly a 1:1 clone, but I tried to recreate the frontend as best as I could. 
This project was not made for production, but for me to expand on my frontend and backend web development knowledge.

# How to test

Simply run npm start in the source folder, after installing React 


# Technologies Used

* React
  
* Framer-Motion: For animations

* Bootstarp: For some basic styling

* Remix Icon: Fr some design icons
  

# Development Process
WIP
